Epilepsy is a disorder characterised by excessive synchronous activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons manifesting in clinical symptoms severe enough for hospitalisation and mortality. Several plasticity mechanisms are involved in the onset, succession, and eventual termination of seizures, with these mechanisms often acting on multiple time scales. To investigate the interactions of these mechanisms, Chris is using experimental data from the Raimondo Lab in Cape Town, South Africa to fit a pathological spiking neural network model being developed at the Sprekeler Lab in Berlin, Germany. This North-South, data-theory research is set to uniquely investigate both ionic plasticity mechanisms of chloride and more general neural plasticity.
