In  the  last  decades,  inhibitory  neurons  have  been  identified  as  one  of  the  core  elements  in  shaping  the  activity  of  excitatory  cells,  modulating  and  expanding  the  spectrum  of  dynamical  phenomena  of  neural  circuits.  In  more  recent  years,  the  combination  of  technologically  advanced  recording  methods  and  the  development  of  transgenic  mice  lines  have  boosted  the  amount  of  experimental  data  on  various  types  of  GABAergic  interneurons.  However,  the  individual  role  of  these  interneurons  are  still  mostly  unresolved.
A  promising  approach  to  gain  insights  and  investigate  the  functional  role  of  inhibitory  neurons  are  computational  models.  We  perform  mathematical  analyses  and  extensive  simulations  of  a  microcircuit  comprising  4  different  celltypes:  excitatory  pyramidal  cells  and  inhibitory  parvalbumin-  ,  somatostatin-    and  vasoactive  intestinal  peptide-expressing  interneurons.  Our  network  model  makes  a  number  of  predictions  that  can  be  tested  in  experiments,  and  hence  may  help  revealing  the  functional  role  of  interneurons  within  microcircuits.
