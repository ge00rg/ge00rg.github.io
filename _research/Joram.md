The  neural  mechanisms  underlying  behaviour  involve  the  coordinated  activity  of  large  numbers  of  neurons  distributed  across  the  brain.  Recent  technological  developments  enable  the  simultaneous  recording  of  such  activity.  The  goal  of  my  research  is  to  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the  neural  mechanisms  underlying  behaviour  by  developing  methods  for  analysing  these  highdimensional  data.    Specifically,  I  am  working  on  perceptual  decision  making  in  humans,  a  collaboration  with  the  Haynes  Lab.
