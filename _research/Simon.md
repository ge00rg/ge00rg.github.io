Neurons  in  the  hippocampus  and  adjacent  brain  areas  show  a  large  diversity  in  their  tuning  to  location  and  head  direction.  The  underlying  circuit  mechanismsare  not  resolved.  In  particular,  it  is  unclear  why  certain  cell  types  are  selective  to  one  spatial  variable,  but  invariant  to  another.  For  example,  place  cells  are  typically  invariant  to  head  direction.  We  use  simulations  and  mathematical  analyses  of  feedforward  and  recurrent  neural  networks  to  study  how  all  observed  spatial  tuning  patterns  —  in  both  their  selectivity  and  their  invariance  —  could  arise  from  the  same  mechanism:  Excitatory  and  inhibitory  synaptic  plasticity  that  is  driven  by  the  spatial  tuning  statistics  of  synaptic  inputs.
