One challenge regarding decision making lies in linking behavioural outcomes with neural activity. In particular, to understand if a choice is driven by external stimuli or internal biases, it is important to disentangle the relative contribution of early sensory areas versus higher order decision-making areas. With this in mind, we investigate the role of pyramidal neurons with active dendrites that integrate bottom-up and top-down inputs simultaneously (Naud & Sprekeler 2018) in a hierarchical network model of decision making (Wimmer et al. 2015). Our goal is to understand how bottom-up and top-down information influences the decision making process, merely using the multiplexed behaviour of these neurons.
