Inhibitory interneurons form canonical circuit motifs across brain areas and have been repeatedly shown to play a role in learning and memory. There are several ways in which interneurons could be involved in learning by shaping synaptic changes. In the first part of my talk, I will discuss inhibition as a mechanism to selectively switch off plasticity at excitatory synapses. In the second part of my talk, I will present recent work on how interneuron circuit structure could guide synaptic plasticity in the context of stimulus-reward association learning: Humans and animals are remarkable at learning which stimuli predict rewards. While the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown, it has been shown that rewards influence plasticity of sensory representations in early sensory areas.  Hence, top-down reward signals can modulate plasticity in local cortical microcircuits. However, synaptic changes require time, but rewards are usually limited in time. Because the two happen on different time scales, it is unclear how reward signals interact with long-term synaptic changes. We hypothesised that interneuron circuits bridge the timescales. We hence investigated how temporary top-down modulation by rewards can interact with local excitatory and inhibitory plasticity to induce long-lasting changes in sensory circuitry. To this end, we constructed spiking and rate-based models of layer 2/3 mouse visual cortex consisting of excitatory pyramidal neurons, and different interneuron populations. I will demonstrate how interneuron networks could store information about the rewarded stimulus to instruct long-term changes in excitatory connectivity in the absence of further reward.
