Directed connectivity inference has become a cornerstone in neuroscience following the recent progress in neuroimaging techniques to characterize neuronal networks. In a recent study, we have developed a method to estimate cortical interactions from fMRI activity based on the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, yielding whole-brain effective connectivity, or EC [1]. This provides a fingerprint of the brain dynamics, which can be used in classification procedures to identify subjects' identities or the task they perform [2]. Based on a recent extension of the formalism in the direction of network theory [3], we can interpret the EC biomarkers for brain dynamics to perform community analysis. Compared to previous approaches, a strength of our approach is to take time into account, as EC characterizes the transition between fMRI activity across the network nodes. We obtain a quantitative picture of how fMRI activity flows in the network, initially segregated within communities, then becoming globally integrated (as described by a functional merging of the communities). The capabilities and limitations for the interpretation of our model-based approach in terms of brain communication will be then discussed [4].
