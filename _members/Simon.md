Simon Weber studied physics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich, Columbia University in New York City and Universidad de La Laguna in Spain. He obtained his B.Sc. in 2009 and his M.Sc. in 2012 in Munich, focusing on statistical biophysics and active matter.
  Simon began his doctoral studies at Humboldt Universität in 2013 and followed his PhD supervisor Henning Sprekeler to Technische Universität Berlin in 2015. His current research focuses on the effects of inhibitory plasticity on adaptive sensory and spatial processing. In particular, he is working to understand how spatially periodic patterns can be obtained from general spatial inputs in feedforward and recurrent neural networks. Moreover, Simon develops methods to analyze experimental data from neurons in the entorhinal cortex, in order to understand local properties of grid cells.
