Denis studied Physics at Heidelberg University, where he worked on
Neuromorphic Hardware for his bachelor's thesis. Currently he is pursuing a
master's degree in Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center in Berlin
and joined the lab in 2017. For his master's thesis he is trying to
understand how biologically motivated constraints to network architectures can
lead to episodic to semantic memory transformations in a mechanistic model of
systems memory consolidation. To this end, he uses methods from machine
learning, computational models from neuroscience and mathematical analysis.
Denis is also interested in algorithms for simulating spiking neural networks
on graphics processing units and has developed the open source software
Brian2CUDA.
