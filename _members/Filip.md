<i>Nothing in cortical computation makes sense except in light of predicting future outcomes of behavioural decisions</i>

Filip Vercruysse studied Chemical Engineering at Ghent University (Belgium) before obtaining a PhD in Neuroscience from the Ã‰cole Polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland). He has a background in experimental and computational neuroscience and is deeply committed to understand the role of feedback processes, i.e. expectation, contextual modulation, on sensory representation. More specifically, he uses computational and theoretical methods to understand the consequences of feedback connections on local network dynamics and how this facilitates information processing in primary sensory systems. The key circuit elements of his spiking neural networks include plastic synapses, dendritic processes and different interneuron subtypes. This allows him to investigate the self-organising properties of biologically inspired microcircuits and their relation with behavioural outcomes.
