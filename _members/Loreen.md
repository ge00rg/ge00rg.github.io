Loreen studied physics at the University of Leipzig and obtained her diploma degree in 2010. Until 2015, she worked at the Central Institute for Mental Health in Mannheim and completed her PhD in computational neuroscience at the BCCN Heidelberg-Mannheim in February 2014. Her research topics included 'high-throughput' fitting of electrophysiological data, mathematical description of single neuron and recurrent network activity as well as computational psychiatry.

Loreen joined the lab August 2015. Her current research is on the functional and computational role of different types of interneurons in neural networks.
