Chris is a young South African eager to become one of the countryâ€™s first computational neuroscientists. He has been passionate about intelligence since early childhood, which lead him to pursue a diverse BSc with majors in biochemistry, computer science, psychology. His MSc/PhD supervisor, Dr Joseph Raimondo, introduced Chris to the field of computational neuroscience and he has been hooked ever since. His ultimate goal is to understand the mysteries surrounding how we think and how to make machines learn.
When not pushing his own intelligence to understand intelligence, Chris enjoys football, local culture, furry animals, and meeting diverse people.
